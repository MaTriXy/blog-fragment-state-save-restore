This repo was originally meant to act as a companion for a blog series, but I now feel the repo is comprehensive and blog posts are not needed.

We take a deep dive into how `Fragment`s in Android save/restore their state during configuration changes. This may seem trivial at first. The first solution that comes to mind is:

  1. Save state in `onSaveInstanceState`.
  2. In `onCreateView`, inflate your view hierarchy and get a handle to your views (using `findViewById`, Butterknife, data-binding, whatever)
  3. Also in `onCreateView`, retrieve previously saved state from the `Bundle` parameter passed in to this method.
  4. Apply the state from step 3 into views from step 2.

However, there are few subtleties to be aware of, especially when a `Fragment` is placed on the backstack. We will use a sample app to explore the issues that can crop up, and see how to fix them.

TL;DR
----
If you are too lazy to go through the source code and posts, here's an executive summary of the take-aways:
  - When a `Fragment` is not at the top of the stack, i.e., it is on the back stack, the `Activity` still gives it a chance to save state (for example when being rotated).
      + The `onSaveInstanceState` is called, followed by `onDestroy`.
      + Later, after rotation, `onCreate` is called.
      + However, none of the view-related methods are called. `onCreateView` and later methods are not called.
  - The above causes issues with state saving if you are not careful
      + You might try to save state for a view assuming it exists, however since `onCreateView` has not been called, you run the risk of `NullPointerException`
      + A simple null check doesn't get the job done since this results in no state being saved at all.


Recipe
----
Based on these learnings, I recommend to split up the "retrieve saved state and apply it to views" process that you normally follow in `onCreateView` into two steps. The suggested recipe for saving/restoring state when it comes to `Fragment`s is:
  - Retrieve state in `onCreate`. Save the retrieved state in a member variable
  - In `onCreateView`, after inflating your layout, finding your views etc, then restore the state of the views using the state you retrieve in `onCreate`
  - In `onSaveInstanceState`, if the views are present, then ask the views for their saved state (by calling the view's `onSaveInstanceState` for example). Save this in the `ouState` parameter.
  - In `onSaveInstanceState`,if the views are not present, then save the state you retrieved in `onCreate` into the `outState` paremeter.

This way, you relay the state you had received in `onCreate` over to the system in `onSaveInstanceState`. So, even if your `Fragment` is on the back stack while it is rotated, it is still able to save state.


Sample Description
----
The sample just contains an `Activity` with two `Fragment`s inside it. The first `Fragment` shows a multiple choice list of Android flagship devices. The second `Fragment` simply contains a `TextView` with a message.

Our goal is to go through the following use cases and see how the `Fragment` life-cycle and the save/restore methods need to be understood in order to achieve all the use cases.

The [basic-example-scenario tag](https://github.com/curioustechizen/blog-fragment-state-save-restore/releases/tag/basic-example-scenario) corresponds to the initial state of the sample. You can use `git checkout basic-example-scenario` to see the initial code.

Use Case 1:
----
  1. Launch the app and hit "Populate"
  2. Select one or more items in the list
  3. Hit "Next" to go to the next screen.
  4. Press the Android Back button to return to the list screen

We expect that the items and choices from Step 2 are remembered.

The tag [basic-scenario-without-savestate](https://github.com/curioustechizen/blog-fragment-state-save-restore/releases/tag/basic-scenario-without-savestate) contains the solution to Use Case 1. Use `git checkout basic-scenario-without-savestate` to see the corresponding code.

Use Case 2:
----
  1. Launch the app and hit "Populate"
  2. Select one or more items in the list
  3. Rotate the device

We expect that the items and choices from Step 2 are remembered.

The tag [use-case-2](https://github.com/curioustechizen/blog-fragment-state-save-restore/releases/tag/use-case-2) contains the code to achieve Use Case 2. The command to use is `git checkout use-case-2`


Use Case 3:
----
  1. Launch the app and hit "Populate"
  2. Select one or more items in the list
  3. Hit "Next" to go to the next screen.
  4. Rotate the device - multiple times
  5. Press the Android Back button to return to the list screen

We expect that the items and choices from Step 2 are remembered.

The tag [use-case-3-solution](https://github.com/curioustechizen/blog-fragment-state-save-restore/tree/use-case-3-solution) shows how to split up your `onCreateView` method and move the state retrieval code to `onCreate`. The command to use is `git checkout use-case-3-solution`.

**Bonus**: The tag [use-case-3-solution-debuglog](https://github.com/curioustechizen/blog-fragment-state-save-restore/tree/use-case-3-solution-debuglog) adds debug logging so that you can clearly see what life cycle methods are called when a device is rotated and the fragment is on the back stack. Use `git checkout use-case-3-solution-debuglog`.
